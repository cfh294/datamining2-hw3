# Data Mining II &mdash; Homework 3

This repository contains code for homework 3 for Dr. Breitzman's Data Mining II course at Rowan University. This was completed on October 13, 2020.

This should only be used as a guide/inspiration for a unique solution, not as a submission by someone else.

The ```.csv``` files found under ```data/``` can also be found [on Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

To generate a new model (this takes forever, I don't suggest it), simply delete ```models/model.bin``` and then run the program again. 

## Dependencies 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Script

```bash
./digit-classifier.py
```
